							    <h1> History of Web Design and Development</h1>
								
                                 First of all let us know the History of Web Designing

                                 Whilst, working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project in 1989 which is now known as WWW (World Wide Web).
                                 The World Wide Web was born during 1991-1993.
                                 From 1993-1996 there established a number of browsers.
                                 Throughout 1996-1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance.
                                 In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags.
                                 CSS & Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) were also introduced in 1996.
                                 During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software.
                                 After that, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was released for Mac in 2000.
                                 During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.
                                 Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into people’s lives.
